# TF2 KillSay
Created by the sewer pig.
## Q: What is a killsay?
### A: It is a feature that some cheats have that immediately says something in chat after killing a player, usually to taunt them. Speaking of cheats...
## Q: Is this a cheat? Can I get a VAC ban for this?
### A: This is not a cheat. It does not inject anything into TF2 nor does it write and/or read process memory. All it does is read the console.log file to search for kills and uses F9 as the killsay bind.
