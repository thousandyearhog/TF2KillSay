## How to use
### Go to the releases page and download the latest release.  
Copy TF2KillSay.exe from the archive and extract it anywhere you want.  
Open TF2KillSay.exe. It should bring you to the settings tab at launch.  
Paste the full path to the folder where TF2 is stored in the first box and paste your name (or any other player) in the second box.  
Go to the home tab and replace the text in the box with whatever you want.  
Place “%v” wherever you want the name of your victim to be. For example, if you kill a player named Bob, “%v FUCK YOU I WILL FIND YOUR ADDRESS THEN I WILL KILL YOUR MOM AND BEAT YOU TO A BLOODY PULP!!!” Will be turned into “Bob FUCK YOU I WILL FIND YOUR ADDRESS THEN I WILL KILL YOUR MOM AND BEAT YOU TO A BLOODY PULP!!!”
Click on the Set button in the settings tab and open TF2 if you haven’t opened it already.
## Q: What is a killsay?
### A: A feature in some cheats that immediately says something in chat after killing a player, usually to taunt them. Speaking of cheats...
## Q: Is this a cheat? Can I get a VAC ban for this?
### A: This is not a cheat. It does not inject anything into TF2 nor does it read and/or write TF2s memory. All it does is read the console.log file to search for kills and uses F9 as the killsay bind.
