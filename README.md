## Q: What is a killsay?
### A: A feature in some cheats that immediately says something in chat after killing a player, usually to taunt them. Speaking of cheats...
## Q: Is this a cheat? Can I get a VAC ban for this?
### A: This is not a cheat. It does not inject anything into TF2 nor does it read and/or write TF2s memory. All it does is read the console.log file to search for kills and uses F9 as the killsay bind.
